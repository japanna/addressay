 * User manual for website "Addressay"
 ******************************************************************

All files necessary to run the web page are in the vhosts/project/ folder, including 
the exported database "project.sql" which can be found in project/includes.
To use the web page, put the files on a local host and use as url "project/index.php".

The project implements a simple website that lets anyone rate any address that the Google Maps
Geocoder service can translate to latitude and longitude. No login is necessary. One can, 
however only rate the same address once within a 24-hour window.

When trying the website, any address can be typed in and rated. However, since the database
is populated with ratings on the downtow San Francisco area, some suggestions are:
- 4 Mint Plaza, San Francisco 94103, CA (or any substring thereof.)
- 941 Mission St, San Francisco.
- 16 12th St., San Francisco.
- etc...

In order to submt an address for rating, one can either click on an address in the suggestion list 
generated from items returned by the Geocoding service, or one can press "enter" in the search box 
to get the first item in the list.

Once an address is submitted, the map will show the address marked with a red marker, and eight sliders
will appear on the page. Choose values beween 1 and 100 (default is 50) and click "submit" to rate this 
address.

The result of the rating shows up in a table. You can see what you just submitted and an average for 
the nearby (~0.5 mile) area for each parameter. On the map, the address you rated will show up as a red marker,
and any ratings nearby will show as blue markers. You can drag as well as zoom in/out on the map.

To rate a new address, click on the link above the map.

The links in the footer are just for show at the moment, as they are more about text/content than about 
implementing functions.
